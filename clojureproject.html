<h2>Part one - setup</h2>
To start with I need to setup a clojure enviroment. I have decided - at least as start - to start on a window7 enviroment.

<h3>IDE</h3>
I'm going to use emacs. In my world I really see no other contender. Emacs and Lisp are closely tied together and I can't see a reason why I should even bother using somethinh else.
So first quest is to download and install emacs for windows.
